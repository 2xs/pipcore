-- Indenter for Pip Coq source code
--
-- Warning: This is _just_ a heuristic, it makes some assumptions on
-- the initial layout, namely:
--
--  - if-then-else's are written either with "then" and "else" each
--    starting on a fresh line, or both of them on one line with words
--    before (such as the "if")
--  - "match" and "end" both appear at the beginning of a line
--  - comments can be nested but detection of opening and closing is
--    easily fooled
--  - the period ending a sentence "." is at the end of the line
--    (in particular, a comment after the period breaks its detection)
