# Minako

Minako Is Not Another Kernel Orchestrator.

Minako is a partition loader and interrupt dispatcher framework for Pip root partitions.

Minako's development is still at a very early stage, and should not be used yet.

More code cleanup and stuff should be added soon.

# Compile
Invoke `make`.

# Run
Invoke `make PARTITION=minako` in Pip's root directory.

# Configure
Edit `minako.cfg`.
