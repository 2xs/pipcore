(**  * Summary 
      In this file we define the required configuration to extract the  MALInternal, MAL, Internal and 
      Services functions from Coq to JSON.
      The JSON output will be analyzed to generate the corresponding C implementation *)
Require Import Model.MAL Model.Hardware Model.ADT Core.Services Core.Internal.
Extraction Language JSON.

(** Coq standard library *)
Extract Inductive unit => "()" [ "()" ].

Extract Inlined Constant ret => "return".
Extract Inlined Constant negb => "not".
Extract Inlined Constant andb => "(&&)".
Extract Inlined Constant bind => "(>>=)".
Extract Inlined Constant orb => "(||)".
